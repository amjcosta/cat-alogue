        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Warsaw! Let's be friends! We can hang out and play and snuggle all day and we'll be best pals!<br />My humans move a lot so I've had to learn to adapt to lots of new environments, but so long as everything smells safe I'm ok. Right now we live in a place where there are birds outside and we're friends. It's the best! And often people come to visit my humans and we're friends too, it's the best!<br />Mostly I just like to relax with my humans and eat and run around! Let's be buddies!</p>
